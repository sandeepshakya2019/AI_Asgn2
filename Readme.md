# Frozen Lake (BnB vs IDA*)

## How to Run
1. Run `FrozenLake/main.py`. This will:
   - Execute both algorithms five times.
   - Generate two GIFs:
     - `bnbFrozen.gif` for the BnB algorithm
     - `idaFrozen.gif` for IDA* algorithm
   - Save execution times in `exec_time.csv`
   - Generate a comparison graph in `exec_time_plot.png`

Run `FrozenLake/main.py` and analyze the results for FrozenLake!

# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Solver

## How to Run
1. Run `TSP/main.py`. This will:
   - Execute both algorithms five times.
   - Generate two GIFs showing the optimization process:
     - `hill_tsp.gif` for Hill Climbing and corresponding tour plot png `hill_tour.png` file
     - `sa_tsp.gif` for Simulated Annealing and corresponding tour plot `sa_tour.png` file
   - Save execution times in `execTime.csv`
   - Generate a comparison graph in `executionTimePlot.png`

Run `TSP/main.py` to analyze the results for TSP!
